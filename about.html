                <p>Buying your ideal car has never been easier. AUTO4SALE allows you to search and compare cars to ensure you find a car that meets your needs and fits your budget.</p>
                <p>AUTO4SALE, a South African owned business and digital marketing platform, launched on the 16th April 1992. We bring together buyers and sellers across all vehicle types. The key to AutoTrader’s success, is that it maintains no transactional barriers and directly connects buyers & sellers by displaying the physical address, telephone number, email address and website address.

                    AUTO4SALE CEO George Mienie said, "We have successfully transitioned the business from print to digital. Our last ever issue of the AUTO4SALE magazine hit the shelves on Thursday, 30 March 2017. We will continue to offer world-class market leading solutions for buyers and sellers of vehicles. As always we have exciting product diversification, launches and marketing campaigns ahead of us."
                    
                    The largest automotive marketplace
                    AUTO4SALE has the largest automotive marketplace in South Africa and gets over 5 million visits each month to its online platforms. With car shoppers conducting many millions of searches across more than 76 000 vehicles on mobile, tablet, desktop devices and apps.
                    
                    AUTO4SALE uses state-of-the-art technology to bring motor vehicle buyers and sellers together. In addition, it was the first in its category in South Africa to launch a fully responsive website. World class iOS and Android applications mean car shoppers can car shop anywhere, anytime.
                    
                    With over 70% of South African dealerships advertised on AUTO4SALE, finding the right vehicle is easy with the assurance of variety and choice.
                    
                    Thousands of private advertisers have sold their vehicles on AUTO4SALE. And with a focus on solving for pain points in the car buying journey, in 2018 AUTO4SALE introduced a managed process called “We Sell” - for people seeking a hassle-free car sale process.
                    
                    AUTO4SALE has created tools for sellers to track online performance. And as the market leader, AUTO4SALE leveraged the large amounts of data in possession to create AutoFuzion - revolutionary software designed to use up to the minute demand and supply trends to help dealers make better pricing and stocking decisions.
                    
                    Vehicle Check was another example of AUTO4SALE’s commitment to transparency in the car buying process and allows car shoppers to check a cars history before buying.
                    
                    While in partnership with Qhubekha, AUTO4SALE created #DriveChange, An initiative which helps hundreds of underprivileged children get bicycles to get to school everyday.
                    
                    In addition, AUTO4SALE also publishes the AUTO4SALE Commercial and AUTO4SALE Agri magazines.</p>
